  <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netwrk is an open platform that promotes all social media that are connected to us, and that we believe are good for the world. Facebook is the first thing you see on our profile, and we hope that people will use it to connect and friend others that they become aware of through our platform. Linkedin, snapchat, and Twitter can all be connected to a person&rsquo;s profile in similar fashion. Your profile becomes a way for anyone to find you on all connected social media. These posts are able to be shared from your profile, and when clicked on, will go to the corresponding platform, therefore promoting your profile on it and also the platform itself. We&rsquo;re trying to be cool with everyone out there, giving you the best local experience possible!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of this data is specified below. Yes, it is natural that you will be sharing some information with us and that it will affect your privacy. So we want to be very clear about how we use the information we collect, who we share it with, and where it can go after it comes on our platform. To be brief, we use the information to provide the best local products and services out there that we continually improve. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your casts cannot go outside an area unless it is deemed legendary. Hey, thats a good thing, but with it also comes the potential that it can be seen nationally by anyone outside that spot. Hanging something undercover is not possible to share or be sent outside where it was posted unless another person takes a picture of it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s also possible, as with any digital information, that someone might be able to access messages forensically or find them in a device&rsquo;s temporary storage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when it comes to sharing outside content or posting your own, you can be rest assured it will not be taken outside of these bounds. </span></p>
